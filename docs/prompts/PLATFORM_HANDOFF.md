# PLATFORM HANDOFF — Tactical Squad Plan

Everything the worktree lanes could **not** do because it is platform-owned: `base44/functions/gameEngine/entry.ts`,
`base44/entities/*.jsonc`, `Patch` records, and anything needing a live backend deploy or `test_backend_function`.

Apply these in the **Base44 chat session**, in order. Phase 3 (P3) is the engine wiring; C3 is the content wiring.
Nothing here has been applied except where a row says APPLIED.

> Status: **accumulating.** Lanes append to this file as they discover platform needs. It is posted to the
> operator when waves 1–4 are merged, and the orchestrator then stops until told Phase 3 is live.

## 0. Already applied to a platform-owned file (verify it survives the next Base44 sync)

| File | Change | Why | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base44/functions/gameEngine/entry.ts` | Two **comment lines only**, added around the settlement-charter block: `// ---------- Begin settlement charter (harness marker) ----------` at :88 and `// ---------- End settlement charter (harness marker) ----------` at :140 | `test/helpers/macro-harness.js` lifts marked regions of this file textually so the macro simulation tests exercise the real engine instead of stubs. The identical convention already existed in this file for the macro-engine block. | None — zero behaviour change, no deploy required. But if the Base44 builder rewrites this file and drops the comments, `test/macro-engine-sim.test.js` fails with `harness region markers not found`. Re-add the two comments. |

## P3 — Engine wiring (after waves 1–3)

- [ ] `createTactical` call site passes `{ seed, nodeKind, weather, fortBonus }`.
- [ ] `tacticalDeploy` accepts `squads: [{ name, type, figures, specialists: [], at?: {q,r}, loadout? }]`.
- [ ] **`tacticalOrders` reads `body.orderAction`, not `body.action`.** Contract amendment Q1 (2026-09-01):
      §4 declared `action` twice in that body, so the squad's action key was shadowed by the dispatch verb
      and the request could not route. The envelope key `action` stays `'tacticalOrders'`; the squad's
      action is `orderAction`. **Confirm what the live handler does today** — it appears to forward
      `body.action` (the literal string `"tacticalOrders"`) into `resolveOrders`.
- [ ] New action `tacticalAuto { gameId }` — auto-resolve the remaining turns for the caller's side.
      Lane E ships the button already wired and **disabled**; it enables when this action exists.
- [ ] `tacticalView` fields persisted via `persistWar()`.
- [ ] Field Amendment `Patch` dispatch filed.

*(Exact function bodies, entity schema JSON and action names are appended by the lanes as they are written.)*

## C3 — Content wiring (after wave 4)

- [ ] Import `base44/shared/catalog.ts` into `gameEngine` **and** `concurrentPlay`, retiring the inlined duplicates.
- [ ] Apply the typed `effects[]` vocabulary in the engine.
- [ ] Enforce `creedLock` / `factionLock`.
- [ ] Point `npcHerald` at the `docs/HERALD_VOICES.md` voices.
- [ ] `base44/entities/ArmyDesign.jsonc` → the `SquadTemplate` shape.
- [ ] Generate every placeholder plate registered in `src/lib/imageLibrary.js` and deliver its URL into
      `src/lib/imagePlates.js` — the full list is `docs/prompts/ART_MANIFEST.md`.
- [ ] Promote each `[PROPOSED — awaiting platform wiring]` section of `docs/GAME_RULES.md` to live.
